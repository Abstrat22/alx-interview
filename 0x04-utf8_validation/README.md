# UTF-8 Validation
This script is designed to validate whether a provided list of integers represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. It checks the byte patterns of the integers to determine if they adhere to the UTF-8 encoding rules. If the data follows the UTF-8 encoding rules, the script returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

# Getting Started
To use this script, simply include the validUTF8 function in your Python project. Ensure that the data argument provided to the function is a list of integers representing the data to be validated.

# Prerequisites
Python 3.x

# Usage
Import the script into your Python project.
Call the validUTF8 function, passing the list of integers as the data argument.

``from utf8_validation import validUTF8

data = [...]  # Provide the list of integers to be validated
result = validUTF8(data)
print(result)``

# Function Description

``def validUTF8(data):
    """
    Checks whether the given data is a valid UTF-8 encoding.

    Args:
    data (list): A list of integers representing the data to be validated.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the data is a valid UTF-8 encoding, else returns False.
